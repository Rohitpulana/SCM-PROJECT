        <center><h1 style="margin-top: 0; padding-top: 60px;" >Why did ISRO launch Chandrayaan on a PSLV rocket?</h1></center>
       <article>
        <p id="p1">
            ISRO originally intended to launch Mangalyaan on their Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) rocket instead of the only roughly half-as-powerful Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). As with most Mars missions, a GSLV rocket could've boosted Mangalyaan out of Earth orbit and onto an interplanetary trajectory to the Red Planet. But the rocket suffered two failures in 2010, just as Mangalyaan was being conceptualized.
<br><br>
Fixing the identified issues in the rocket's design and preparing for another launch could have taken at least three years, placing it close to the time-sensitive November 2013 launch window for Mars. The next launch opportunity was in 2016, so ISRO decided to launch Mangalyaan on a PSLV rocket in 2013 instead.
<br><br>
However, the PSLV could only place Mangalyaan in a highly elliptical Earth orbit. It would be the spacecraft's job to fire its engines at precise points in each orbit multiple times over the next few weeks to set itself on a trajectory to Mars, or it would miss the planet entirely. The trajectory design was highly unusual for a Mars mission but it worked. Once the spacecraft arrived at the Red Planet roughly 300 days later, it fired its engines again and successfully entered Mars orbit.

        <center><h1 style="margin-top: -400px;">What technologies did ISRO develop for Chandrayaan-1?</h1></center>
        <p id="p1">ISRO built upon its experience with Chandrayaan 1, India's first lunar orbiter, to develop Mangalyaan. The Mars spacecraft was a modified design of the Chandrayaan 1 spacecraft with upgraded components as required. For example, there were more and upgraded solar panels to make up for reduced solar energy available at Mars
<br><br>
            ISRO also developed the ability for its ground stations to communicate with a spacecraft on another planet. With Mangalyaan, there were two-way communication lags of up to 42 minutes; this gap also demanded enabling the spacecraft to make autonomous decisions for situations where there would be no time for humans to be in the loop, something that wasn't necessary for Chandrayaan 1.</p>
